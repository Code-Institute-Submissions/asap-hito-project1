Readme Project 1 A Website in progress

Main structure of the webiste is there in a couple of commits.
Issues remain with some presentation aspects. Definitely hasn't come out the way it was in my head.
Main issues that need fixing are:
-Footer and Header Design
-Font choice (more limited than previously expected)
-Unhappy with some layout aspects but unable to achieve expected outcomes with CSS
-Struggling to make a modern looking website in the style I was looking for without custom graphical assets that I do not have access to
-Tried to do too much with the time I had (I had plenty but for various reasons could not get started with the project until late
-Please note that this does not represent what the final result
