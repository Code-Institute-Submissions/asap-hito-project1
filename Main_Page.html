            <p>DnD or "Dungeons and Dragons" is a classic role playing game played with pen and paper. 
                Currently in its 5th iteration, Dungeons and Dragons consists of one Dungeon Master 
                narrating and crafting the story of the game and several Player Characters living out roles 
                within the Dungeon Master’s world. It is easy enough for children to learn, but complex enough 
                to take the most seasoned veterans years to master.</p>
